    <h6>Hi there!</h6>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Ionic Example App. Here you can see different examples on how to use the Ionic Framework.
    </p>
    <h6>About the app</h6>
    <p>
        These examples are made in my spare time and the way I think they could be implemented. My way is not perfect and I am always
        willing to learn. So if you have any remarks or improvements, don't hesitate to create an issue on the
        <a (tap)="open_github_page()">github page</a>.
    </p>
    <h6>Api and data storage</h6>
    <p>
        With some cordova plugins it is required to connect the app to an external resource, for example the upload part of the transfer
        plugin. For that I will create an API (written in the C# dotnet core framework). This API will run on the following endpoint
        <a href="https://api.dtaalbers.com/ionic-example-app">https://api.dtaalbers.com/ionic-example-app</a>.
        This api will recieve and store and data you send to it. So be aware of that. Docs will be available when it goes live.
    </p>
