    <h6>Hi there!</h6>
    <p>
        My name is Tom Aalbers. I am a reasonable experienced developer (full stack) in the Ionic, Aurelia and .NET frameworks. I
        work with these frameworks every day.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A long time ago I started the <code>Ionic 2 Examples</code> repo which into, I added a few examples on how to work
        with the Ionic Framework. I received a lot of positive feedback and requests after that. So that is why I started
        this ionic example app to show some examples on how to use the framework. If you want to get in touch you can head
        over to <a (tap)="open_developer_site()">my website</a> and contact me through any of the options there. If you can't
        find your example, head over to <a (tap)="open_github_page()">the github page</a> and create an issue to request
        it! I will try to add them when I can!
